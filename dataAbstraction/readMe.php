// Data Abstraction is one of the key principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows you to hide the complex implementation details of a class while exposing only the essential features to the user.
// Think of it as focusing on "what" an object can do, rather than "how" it does it. For example, when you use a TV remote, you know which buttons to press to change channels or adjust the volume, but you don't need to understand the internal mechanisms of how the remote works.

// Encapsulation of Complex Logic: Abstraction hides unnecessary details and exposes essentials.
