Data encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming. In simple terms, it refers to the practice of hiding the internal details of a class while exposing only the necessary parts to the outside world.
In PHP, we achieve encapsulation by setting the visibility of class properties and methods using access modifiers:
public: Accessible from anywhere.
private: Accessible only within the class itself.
protected: Accessible within the class and its subclasses.
