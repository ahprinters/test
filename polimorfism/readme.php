// Polymorphism is a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class. It refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method in different ways. In simple terms, polymorphism allows you to call the same method on different objects, and each object can perform the method in its own way.
// In PHP, polymorphism is often achieved using inheritance and interfaces. It allows methods in a base class to be overridden in child classes, enabling each class to have its unique behavior while sharing a common interface.
